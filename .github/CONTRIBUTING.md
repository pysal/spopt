## Style and format

1. At the time of this writing, Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12 are the officially supported versions.
2. This project implements the linting and formatting conventions of [`ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) on all incoming Pull Requests. To ensure a PR is properly linted and formatted prior to creating a Pull Request, [install `pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) in your development environment and then [set up the configuration of pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/#3-install-the-git-hook-scripts).
