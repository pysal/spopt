    "A required preliminary step is to obtain the 'raw' data for the area in which you are operating. This takes the form of `.pbf` files, which can be obtained from the [geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/_) portal. In our case, we obtain the [Ireland and Northern Ireland](https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/ireland-and-northern-ireland.html) `.pbf` file. Once downloaded, the `.pbf` needs to be processed using a series of extraction, partitioning, and customization commands. This is easiest to do as a shell script. The version of this script for this example can be found in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/fiendskrah/f4d267ee7298ff9d0a9feb387b051b39). it looks like this:\n",

    "After the pre-processing steps are completed, the OSRM backend docker container can be activated.
